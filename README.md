# Basic Bingo Application

This is a really simple basic bingo application written during covid isolation for a retirement home.

It assumes you have your own way of creating bingo cards, and just need to digitally communicate the selected card.

The site is currently deployed to nearlyfreespeech.net by using winscp to sync the protected folder in the repo with the protected folder on the server.
